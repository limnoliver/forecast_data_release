  Data to support near-term forecasts of stream temperature using process-guided deep learning and data assimilation


abstract: >-
  This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature
  forecasting models that made real-time predictions in the Delaware River Basin during 2021.
  The model is driven by weather forecasts and observed releases and produces maximum water temperature
  forecasts for the issue day (day 0) and 7 days into the future (days 1-7) for five sites in the 
  Delaware River Basin. This data release captures the entire forecasting period that is reported in
  Zwart et al. 2021, and is an extensionsion of a previous data release that contains all data needed
  to build these models but only extends to July 16, 2021. Additionally, this release contains a tidy
  version of the model predictions with paired observations for easier reuse.
