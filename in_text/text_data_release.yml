  Data to support near-term forecasts of stream temperature using process-guided deep learning and data assimilation


abstract: >-
  This data release contains the forcings and outputs of 7-day ahead maximum water temperature
  forecasting models that made real-time predictions in the Delaware River Basin during 2021.
  The model is driven by weather forecasts and observed reservoir releases and produces maximum water temperature
  forecasts for the issue day (day 0) and 7 days into the future (days 1-7) at five sites.
  This data release captures the entire forecasting period that is reported in
  Zwart et al. 2021, and is an extension of a previous data release that contains all data needed
  to build these models but only extends to July 16, 2021 (Oliver et al. 2021). Additionally,
  this release contains a tidy version of the model predictions with paired observations for easier reuse.

      NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System v12.0 0.25-degree operational model output for the 00 UTC forecast cycle from 2021-04-15 to 2021-09-30.
      These data are aggregated to the daily scale and NOAA GEFS grid cells are matched to the centroid of the target stream segment. The target stream segment
      seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.

      
      The zipped folder contains one netCDF file per forecast issue date evaluated in Zwart and others 2021, such
      that the file name is final_noaa_gefs_{extent}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_{cycle}_forecast_segments.nc. Archiving of the NOAA GEFS
      product was changed from USGS NGWOS priority basins early in the record (extent = NGWOS) to the continental U.S. starting
      on 2021-05-26 which is reflected in the name change (extent = CONUS). The cycle refers to one of the four forecasts
      issued each day by NOAA; one at 00:00 (00), 06:00 (06), 12:00 (12), 18:00 (18).
      


      Example code for how to read the NOAA GEFS .nc files can be found in the "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).

        The closest river reach from the Geospatial Fabric v1.1, by Euclidean distance, from the monitoring site.
        Matches were limited to a 500m buffer of the monitoring site. The reach number is from the field "nsegment_v1_1" in the
        Geospatial Fabric for the National Hydrologic Model v1.1.
        
        
        Once the original reach match was assigned, the matched segment was reassigned if the endpoint of the
        upstream reach was closer to the monitoring site (by river distance) than the endpoint of the matched reach.
        If the upstream endpoint was closer, but there was a confluence directly upstream, then the original match was kept.

    data-description: >-
      Forecasts of daily maximum stream temperature for five select locations in the Delaware River Basin issued from 2021-04-16 to 2021-09-30.
      The target stream segment seg_id_nat (National Geospatial Fabric segment code) is used as the location identifier for these data.

      
      Forecasts were generated with a 1) persistence model that used the most recent observed daily maximum
      temperature as the 7-day ahead forecast ("persistence"), 2) a deep learning model ("no_DA"), and a
      3) deep learning model with data assimilation ("DA"). Code that trained the deep learning models can
      be found in the "run-pgdl-da " repository, and code that generated the forecasts can be found in the
      "forecast-pgdl-da" repository in Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910).


      The zipped folder contains two files per stream segment, model, forecast issue date, and scenario (10080 files).
      The file naming scheme is lstm_seg_id_nat[{segment}]_{model}_forecast[{date}]_release[{scenario}],
      which is unique to the five stream segments (1571, 1573, 1641, 1565, 1450 {segment}), three models (DA, no_DA, persistence {model}),
      168 issue dates (in YYYY-MM-DD format {date}), and two reservoir release scenario (0cfs or 100cfs {scenario}). The two files per unique
      combination include a forecast netCDF file (.nc) and metadata file (.xml).

      
      Since observations of daily maximum stream temperature were not available when we issued
      the forecast, the persistence forecast files have NA's for the daily maximum stream temperature
      prediction. When evaluating the performance of the persistence forecasts against the
      deep learning models, we use yesterday's maximum temperature value as the forecast for
      7 days into the future. See the evaluation code in the "evaluate-forecast" repository in
      Zwart and others 2021 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5164910) for this adjustment.

      For the +100 cfs scenario, we did not pair observervations with predictions.

process-description: >-
  The data in this release were retrieved from the National Water Information System (NWIS),
  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), or generated by one of the data-driven
  modeling approaches to predict maximum water temperature. The models estimate the relationship
  between model drivers (weather data, reservoir releases) and maximum water temperature to
  make forecasts of maximum water temperature 7 days into the future.
